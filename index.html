<h2>Usage notes</h2>
<p>repo supports rootless</p>
<p>ping 四日同時同地球回転くるくる人型は四角錐の体現#6609 in #dopamine if you want a package here or something idk</p>
<p>all tweaks on this repo are tested working with dopamine AND palera1n rootless (except for the ones with missing dependencies)</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p><b>2023-10-15</b> frcoal repo is now on Canister yippeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>2023-09-05</b> Removed BTManager+ and Waves since they are broken (BTManager+ has dependencies, couldn't get it to work, might try again later. Waves is still missing dependencies). By this point, I'd say the repo has served its original purpose, but I've started publishing my own tweaks here, so I'll keep the repo around.</p>
<p><b>2023-06-21</b> Atria is in the process of being officially released rootless on Chariz. Get it there!</p>
<p><b>2023-05-28</b> Sonitus was officially released. Get it on Chariz! (The version on this repo never worked, and it was already pulled a few days ago.) Also, ren7995, the developer of Atria, has come back from retirement/hiatus for an Atria update! Thank you, ren! More information <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/13rp38z/free_release_update_atria_beta_testing_140_beta/">here</a> (including beta discord invite).</p>
<p><b>2023-05-05</b> Alderis was pulled from the repo because it was officially released for rootless. Please get it from Chariz!</p>
<p><b>2023-05-01</b> Eneko official rootless is out but I'm told that it's broken 🗿 the version on the repo will remain for the time being</p>
<p><b>2023-04-23</b> <s>Eneko FINALLY fixed</s> <s>ok apparently it's still busted somehow pls test pls pls test</s> ok nevermind it's actually fine, also respring button fixed on printemps so get that hot new update</p>
<p><b>2023-04-16</b> Those namecheap fuckers suspended my domain until I verified my email address LOL anyways clearnet site is back online now</p>
<p><b>2023-04-06</b> Changed the bundle id of uptime to "com.mtac.uptimealt" so that it does not conflict with the official Havoc package.</p>
<p><b>2023-04-05</b> Uptime (control center tweak) is officially available rootless from Havoc now, but I've heard that it behaves differently (shows different text), so I will leave the existing version on this repo. Also, Cylinder Reborn official rootless from Chariz does not support palera1n rootless, so I'm having trouble deciding whether to re-host the version that used to be on this repo because it works on palera1n rootless.</p>
